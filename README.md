## Project Overview

Our 2024 robot was engineered to:

- **Navigate autonomously** using pre-defined trajectories.
- **Detect and track game elements** utilizing dual vision systems.
- **Execute complex maneuvers** with precision through advanced control algorithms.

Key technologies and tools employed:

- **Java** with **WPILib** for robot control.
- **PathPlanner** for trajectory planning.
- **Limelight** for AprilTag and reflective tape detection.
- **YOLOv5** for real-time object detection.
- **PID and feedforward control** for motion profiling.
- **Sensor fusion** integrating encoders, IMU, and vision data.
